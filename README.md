# Restart is recommended after install
          
# I recommend to not install GlumSak in a directory that needs admin rights to access it, it can cause multiple errors!
    
# What is GlumSak?
This project originally was a joke and I never thought that I'll do this some day.
This project is highly inspired from emusak-ui  by CapitaineJSparrow. With the difference 
that I did all the things from ground up myself. This is probably my biggest and most 
time consuming project, but I really enjoy developing it. 
  
# What can it do?
  - Install keys, shaders and firmwares to yuzu (shader not supported currently) and ryu with only a few clicks!
  - To select a portable install open the settings with the button on the left and select the folder of the portable Yuzu/Ryujinx make sure you select the folder that contains the filesystem folders and files, for Ryu it would be called "portable" and for Yuzu it's "user" then restart the app 
  
# Create your own paste
  - Pastes can be easily created using the official PasteCreator-Plugin
  - Pastes do NOT contain pirated contents rather point to links, creators of pastes and I do not take responsibility for any copyright violations. 
  - Everything is for educational use!
  - Pastes follow this syntax: nameOfTheGame=https://directDownloadLink.zip | shadercount (a number)
  
# Future plans
  [Roadmap](https://trello.com/b/NgcOhYhr/glumsak-road-map)
  
# Current supported shaders
  - All as long as you use a valid shaders file
  
# What is it written in?
  - C# Winforms/WPF in .NET Framework 4.8.1
  
# UI screenshots (UI could differ from the image depending on how fast I update it)
